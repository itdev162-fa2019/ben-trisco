Project Description
	For project 1, I focused on Option 2 for requirement 1. 
I've created an ASP.NET Core using Visual Studio Code for a website utilizing the technologies
learned throughout the course. This is just a basic website. I wanted to expand on the .NET backend
portion of the class.

	ASP.NET Core has a lot of features. ASP.NET features cross-platform
and container support, able to deploy to Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
ASP.NET offers high performance, being one of the fastest web application
frameworks available. One of the reasons ASP.NET Core is faster is because of
it's use of asynchronous patterns within the MVC and Kestrel frameworks.
ASP.NET has merged together MVC and Web API, combining the two to simplify development.
ASP.NET allows for web applications to be self hosted. Also, ASP.NET allows
for the support of action filters, allowing developers to implement functionality that
can be applied to an entire controller or action without modifying the action itself.
This can be used for caching, error handling, authorization, or custom logic.
The caching output technology in the ASP.NET is easy and supports caching output
within the memory on the web server itself.

Thank you for reading.
